# Summary

This image is similar to offical mysql docker image, with multi-database support.

    docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE=default_db \
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE1=project1_db \
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE2=project2_db \
        -d crazycode/mysql

# How to use this image

## Start a `mysql` server instance

Starting a MySQL instance is simple:

    docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d crazycode/mysql

â€¦ where some-mysql is the name you want to assign to your container, my-secret-pw is the password to be set for the MySQL root user and tag is the tag specifying the MySQL version you want. See the list above for relevant tags.


## Connect to MySQL from an application in another Docker container

This image exposes the standard MySQL port (3306), so container linking makes the MySQL instance available to other application containers. Start your application container like this in order to link it to the MySQL container:

	docker run --name some-app --link some-mysql:mysql -d app-that-uses-mysql

## Connect to MySQL from the MySQL command line client

The following command starts another MySQL container instance and runs the `mysql` command line client against your original MySQL container, allowing you to execute SQL statements against your database instance:

	docker run -it --link some-mysql:mysql --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'

... where `some-mysql` is the name of your original MySQL Server container.

More information about the MySQL command line client can be found in the [MySQL documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/mysql.html)

## Container shell access and viewing MySQL logs

The `docker exec` command allows you to run commands inside a Docker container. The following command line will give you a bash shell inside your `mysql` container:

	docker exec -it some-mysql bash

The MySQL Server log is available through Docker's container log:

	docker logs some-mysql

## Using a custom MySQL configuration file

The MySQL startup configuration is specified in the file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`, and that file in turn includes any files found in the `/etc/mysql/conf.d` directory that end with `.cnf`. Settings in files in this directory will augment and/or override settings in `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`. If you want to use a customized MySQL configuration, you can create your alternative configuration file in a directory on the host machine and then mount that directory location as `/etc/mysql/conf.d` inside the `mysql` container.

If `/my/custom/config-file.cnf` is the path and name of your custom configuration file, you can start your `mysql` container like this (note that only the directory path of the custom config file is used in this command):

	docker run --name some-mysql -v /my/custom:/etc/mysql/conf.d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d crazycode/mysql

This will start a new container `some-mysql` where the MySQL instance uses the combined startup settings from `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` and `/etc/mysql/conf.d/config-file.cnf`, with settings from the latter taking precedence.

Note that users on host systems with SELinux enabled may see issues with this. The current workaround is to assign the relevant SELinux policy type to your new config file so that the container will be allowed to mount it:

	chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /my/custom

## Environment Variables

When you start the `mysql` image, you can adjust the configuration of the MySQL instance by passing one or more environment variables on the `docker run` command line. Do note that none of the variables below will have any effect if you start the container with a data directory that already contains a database: any pre-existing database will always be left untouched on container startup.

### `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`

This variable is mandatory and specifies the password that will be set for the MySQL `root` superuser account. In the above example, it was set to `my-secret-pw`.

### `MYSQL_DATABASE`

This variable is optional and allows you to specify the name of a database to be created on image startup. If a user/password was supplied (see below) then that user will be granted superuser access ([corresponding to `GRANT ALL`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/adding-users.html)) to this database.

### `MYSQL_DATABASE0` ... `MYSQL_DATABASE9`

These variables are optional and allow you to specify the name of other databases to be created on image startup. If a user/password was supplied (see below) then that user will be granted superuser access ([corresponding to `GRANT ALL`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/adding-users.html)) to this database.

### `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

These variables are optional, used in conjunction to create a new user and to set that user's password. This user will be granted superuser permissions (see above) for the database specified by the `MYSQL_DATABASE` variable. Both variables are required for a user to be created.

Do note that there is no need to use this mechanism to create the root superuser, that user gets created by default with the password specified by the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable.

### `MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`

This is an optional variable. Set to `yes` to allow the container to be started with a blank password for the root user. *NOTE*: Setting this variable to `yes` is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing, since this will leave your MySQL instance completely unprotected, allowing anyone to gain complete superuser access.
